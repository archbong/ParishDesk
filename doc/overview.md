# Project Overview — ParishKeeper

ParishKeeper is a modular church administration system designed to support missionaries, pastors, and multi-church setups. It manages Sunday teachings, attendance, finances, events, assets, welfare cases, prayer requests, and member communication.

This MVP establishes the foundational backend for future expansion, internship participation, and diocese-wide deployment.
